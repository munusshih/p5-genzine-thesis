                                inspiration for
                                creative coding stems from the frustration I
                                faced in
                                traditional
                                computer science education. When I first started
                                learning to
                                code, I
                                was excited about its potential to connect
                                people and make a
                                positive impact on the world. I believed that
                                coding was a
                                powerful
                                tool that could foster creative problem-solving
                                and bring people
                                together. However, my experience with
                                traditional computer
                                science
                                courses left me feeling frustrated and
                                uninspired.</span></p>
                <p class="c11"><span class="c0">These courses were primarily
                                focused on
                                learning programming languages like C++ and
                                Java, but they
                                failed to
                                teach us how to create projects that could
                                engage and connect
                                people. Instead, we were asked to develop
                                mundane programs such
                                as
                                bank account systems. While these systems could
                                be technically
                                challenging, they lacked the creativity and
                                imagination I
                                sought.</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">I vividly remember wanting to use
                                code to
                                build projects that would bring people together
                                and create a
                                sense
                                of community. I felt trapped in a rigid system
                                that left no room
                                for
                                creative expression. Although I desired to use
                                technology for
                                social
                                change, the curriculum wasn&#39;t designed to
                                accommodate such
                                thinking. When I expressed my concerns to my
                                professors, I was
                                told
                                that this was simply how the coding world
                                operated and that if I
                                couldn&#39;t handle the basics, I wasn&#39;t
                                suited for more
                                creative applications of code.</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fortunately, my passion for using

                                journey of
                                self-discovery and exploration, searching for
                                new avenues in
                                creative coding. That&#39;s when I discovered
                                p5.js, a web-based
                                version of the Processing platform created by
                                Lauren McCarthy in 2014. This
                                accessible
                                and
                                adaptive JavaScript library aimed to make
                                creative coding more
                                approachable for artists, designers, educators,
                                and beginners
                                like
                                myself.</span></p>

                                found myself immersed in the world of creative
                                coding. I created
                                interactive art installations, web animations,
                                and other

                                projects that were not only technically
                                challenging but also
                                allowed
                                me to explore my creativity and bring my ideas

                                utilitarianism over creative exploration and

                                This class was an eye-opening experience for me
                                and inspired me
                                to
                                reflect on my own journey through computer
                                science education and
                                the

                <p class="c11"><span class="c0">My frustrations with computer
                                science
                                education stemmed from my own experiences in the
                                field. When I
                                was
                                in school, I often felt frustrated by the
                                emphasis on
                                math-oriented
                                assignments and tests, and the lack of focus on
                                creativity and
                                purpose-driven projects. I should clarify that I
                                didn&#39;t
                                actually
                                major in computer science (CS), but rather in
                                engineering
                                science.
                                However, I took several CS classes out of
                                interest, only to find
                                myself feeling increasingly uninspired and
                                frustrated. It&#39;s
                                disheartening to see how traditional CS
                                education can monopolize
                                the
                                coding world and fail to engage and inspire
                                individuals like
                                myself,
                                who are not necessarily aiming to be computer
                                scientists but are
                                simply interested in the art of coding. It&#39;s
                                clear that the
                                traditional approach to teaching code has some
                                serious
                                limitations,
                                and I am passionate about exploring alternative
                                methods that
                                prioritize creative exploration and personal

                                of my
                                computer science education was the writing
                                tests. You might be
                                wondering, &ldquo;What writing tests?&rdquo;
                                Well, we were asked
                                to
                                write code on paper without any means to test or
                                verify it. We
                                were
                                not provided with a console log or any debugging
                                tools, and it
                                felt
                                like working inside a black box. We were given
                                only a paper with
                                prompts and another paper to write our code,
                                without even
                                pseudo-code. It was as if we were ChatGPT,
                                expected to produce
                                actually runnable code without any way to test
                                its
                                functionality.
                                Our code was then reviewed by a human, typically
                                the TA of the
                                class, to determine if our logic and syntax were
                                correct and if
                                we
                                followed the prompt. Even small mistakes like
                                missing a
                                semicolon or

                                a deduction of most of our points because it
                                could render the

                                approach to testing
                                was
                                entirely counterintuitive and served to
                                discourage and exclude
                                students who might have otherwise been
                                interested in coding. It

                                possible that even students who were interested

                                professional software engineer were discouraged.

                                absurd, unfortunately, this way of teaching is

                                realized how similar the scaffolding in design

                                of printer, ink, and paper can all have an
                                impact on the final

                                lighting, temperature, etc.). For instance,
                                different browsers
                                may

                                is

                                replicate with traditional zines. Coded zines
                                can also
                                incorporate

                                This can add a

                <p class="c11"><span class="c0">The postprint stage is where
                                things get
                                exciting. With a traditional zine, the postprint
                                stage involves
                                distributing or publishing physical copies.
                                However, with a
                                coded
                                zine, there are multiple layers of postprint.
                                Firstly, there is
                                the
                                printed copy, which may be unique to each
                                individual who prints
                                it.
                                Secondly, there is the source code, which can be
                                shared and
                                remixed
                                by others to create new versions of the zine.
                                This opens up a
                                whole
                                new level of interactivity and collaboration
                                that traditional
                                zines
                                do not offer.</span></p>

                                also have a digital counterpart in the form of a

                                generated
                                from the source code. This website can also be
                                distributed,
                                shared,
                                and viewed with ease, allowing for even greater
                                reach and
                                accessibility. The website is a living document
                                that reflects

                                the source code has changed in real-time and
                                offers all the
                                interactivity of the coded zine. People who do
                                not read the
                                source
                                code can also just read or play with the zine in
                                its website
                                format.
                                And if they want, they can print out a version
                                of it and
                                distribute
                                their unique printed copy instead.</span></p>
                <p class="c11"><span class="c0">With coded zines, the postprint

                                between creator

                                creativity. While this can make the process more
                                complicated, it
                                also makes it more exciting and rewarding for

                                the way forward?
                                Or

                                allow for self-circulating publications that

                                function for each of
                                these
                                pages. Test the starter code as examples, you
                                can also structure
                                your code like this.</span></p><a

                                invited readers to

                                Similarly, forking zines allows for a more

                                widely-used tool for collaborative design. The
